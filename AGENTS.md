# Repository Guidelines

- Run `shellcheck` on all modified `*.sh` files and fix any warnings.
- Keep `README.md` updated whenever scripts or dependencies change.
- Use `#!/usr/bin/env bash` and `set -euo pipefail` in shell scripts.
- Prefer 4-space indentation in shell scripts and markdown files.
- After edits, if shell scripts changed, run `shellcheck` before committing.
